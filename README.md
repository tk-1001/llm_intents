# Tools for Assist _(Custom Integration for Home Assistant)_

Additional tools for LLM-backed Assist for Home Assistant:

* **Web Search** powered by your choice of _Brave_ or _SearXNG_
* **Location Search** powered by Google Places
* **Routes & Travel Time** powered by Google Routes
* **Wikipedia**
* **Weather Forecast**
* **YouTube Search and Playback**
* **Basic Utilities** — Calculator, Kitchen Unit Converter, and Date Information

Each tool is optional and configurable via the integrations UI. Some tools require API keys, but are usable on free tiers.
A caching layer is utilised in order to reduce both API usage and latency on repeated requests for the same information within a 2-hour period.

Additionally, a customisable clone of Home Assistants inbuilt `Assist` tooling API can be enabled and used with your Conversation Agents:
- Edit the hidden prompt that the Assist API injects into your system prompt, if this is not to your liking, or conflicts with instructions that you have provided in your own prompt.
- Disable any of the default Assist API tools that you don't want your Conversation Agents to have access to.
- This is named `Home Control` in the list of tools.

### 🗺️ Google Routes

Computes travel distance and duration from a configured home address to any destination, using the Google Routes API. The duration includes live traffic for driving and motorcycle/scooter trips, making it suitable for questions like:

* `"how far of a drive is it to the airport"`
* `"how long would it take to drive to X"`
* `"when should I leave to get to X by 6pm"` — the LLM uses the returned duration to work backwards from the target arrival time.

When a future departure time is supplied, the API returns predicted traffic for that time window rather than current conditions.

#### Requirements

* Requires a [Google API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) with **both** the **Routes API** and the **Places API (New)** enabled. The Places API is used to improve destination accuracy; you do not need to enable the Google Places tool in this integration.
* The same Google API key can be shared with the Google Places tool if it is configured.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Enable "Google Routes" during setup.
2. Enter your Google API key (the same key used for Google Places if configured).
3. Enter your home address — this is used as the starting point for all route lookups.
4. Choose a default travel mode — used whenever the LLM doesn't specify one (e.g. select `WALK` if you don't drive).

#### LLM-provided arguments

| Argument         | Required | Default            | Description                                                            |
|------------------|----------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `destination`    | ✅        | —                  | Destination address, place name, or business name in the user's words. |
| `departure_time` | ❌        | `now`              | ISO 8601 departure time. Omit for an immediate departure.              |
| `mode`           | ❌        | configured default | One of `DRIVE`, `WALK`, `BICYCLE`, `TRANSIT`, `TWO_WHEELER`.           |

#### Options

| Setting                | Required | Default | Description                                                             |
|------------------------|----------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `API Key`              | ✅        | —       | Google API key with both Routes API and Places API (New) enabled        |
| `Home Address`         | ✅        | —       | Starting point for route calculations (e.g. `123 Main St, Springfield`) |
| `Default Travel Mode`  | ✅        | `DRIVE` | Travel mode used when the LLM doesn't specify one                       |

Distance is reported in miles or kilometres based on your Home Assistant unit system.

### ⛅ Weather Forecast

Rather than accessing the internet directly for weather information, this tool utilises your existing Home Assistant weather integration and makes the forecast data accessible to your LLM in an intelligent manner.

At a minimum, this tool requires a weather entity that provides either daily or twice-daily forecast data.
It is recommended, though optional, to also specify a weather entity that provides hourly weather data.

For cases where a specific days weather is requested (eg: `today`, `tomorrow`, `wednesday`), the hourly data will be provided if available.
If data for the week is requested, no hourly forecast entity is set, or the hourly forecast does not contain data for the requested day, the daily weather data will be used instead.

#### Requirements

* An existing weather forecast integration configured within Home Assistant.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Select "Weather Forecast" during setup.
2. Select the weather entity that provides daily forecast information.
3. Optionally, select the weather entity that provides hourly forecast information.
4. Optionally, select a local temperature sensor entity to display current temperature for today's hourly forecast.

### Options

| Setting                      | Required | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Daily Weather Entity`       | ✅        | The weather entity to use for daily weather forecast data                                                   |
| `Hourly Weather Entity`      | ❌        | The weather entity to use for hourly weather forecast data                                                  |
| `Current Temperature Sensor` | ❌        | Optional local sensor entity to provide current temperature when requesting today's hourly weather forecast |

### 🎥 YouTube Search + Playback

Searches YouTube for videos and enables playback on compatible media players. The tool combines YouTube search capabilities with intelligent media player detection to provide a seamless video playback experience.

Search results include video titles, URLs, channel names, descriptions, and publication dates. When a user requests to play a video, the search results are automatically used with the playback tool to start video on the appropriate device.

#### Requirements

* YouTube search is provided by `yt-dlp`; no API key is required.

#### Configuration Steps

1. Select "YouTube" during setup.

#### Playback Compatibility

The YouTube tool works seamlessly with Home Assistant media players that support video playback. Video-capable devices are automatically detected based on their `device_class` attribute:

**Supported Device Classes:**

* `tv` - Television devices (e.g., smart TVs, Android TV boxes)
* `receiver` - AV receivers with video output

**Not Supported:**

* `speaker` - Audio-only devices are automatically excluded
* Media players without a `device_class` set - These must be explicitly configured

**Playback Targeting:**
Videos can be played by specifying:

* **Entity ID** - Direct entity selection (e.g., `media_player.living_room_tv`)
* **Area** - Play on all video-capable devices in an area (e.g., "Living Room")
* **Device ID** - Target a specific device by its device registry ID

The tool automatically filters media players to only include video-capable devices when using area-based targeting, ensuring videos are only sent to devices that can display them.

#### How It Works

1. **Search**: When a user requests a YouTube video, the `search_youtube` tool searches YouTube through `yt-dlp` and returns matching videos with metadata.
2. **Music search**: The `search_music` tool checks Home Assistant's local media directories first. If no local track matches, it searches YouTube for official audio and prefers shorter results.
3. **Playback**: The `play_video` and `play_music` tools play the selected result on the target device.
4. **Caching**: YouTube search results are cached for 2 hours to reduce requests and improve response times for repeated queries.

### 🏡 Home Control API

The Home Control API is a direct clone of Home Assistants inbuilt Assist API, but with some customisation exposed.

The Assist API, much like this and other tool API providers, injects some instructional directives into the system prompt on how to use the tools provided to them.
In some situations, you may find that these conflict with instructions that you have provided your agent directly via your own system prompt.

The Home Control API exposes Assists hidden prompt as a Jinja2 template that can be freely modified.
Additionally, the inbuilt Assist tools can be disabled on a per-tool basis, in case there are tools that you do not wish your agent to have access to, but still see the exposed entities related to them.

**As the Home Control API is a direct clone of the Assist API, it is strongly recommended to only use either `Assist` OR `Home Control` in your Conversation Agents, and not both together.**
